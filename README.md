I no longer have this server.

Went through many iterations of servers self-hosting all kinds of things.

At one point I was self-hosting literally every service that I used online, that is cloud drive, email, instant messaging, online music library, online video library, VPN, GitLab, SearX as my personal meta-search engine, calDAV for calendar and contacts, and many more I can't remember right now.

Turns out it's a massive pain in the butt to maintain everything.

I use iCloud now. It werks.
